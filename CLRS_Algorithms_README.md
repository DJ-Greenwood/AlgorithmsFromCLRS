# Algorithms from Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS)

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks that implement and explain the algorithms presented in the seminal textbook *Introduction to Algorithms* by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein (often referred to as CLRS). Each notebook is dedicated to a specific algorithm or concept from the book, providing a hands-on, interactive approach to learning.

## About the CLRS Book

*Introduction to Algorithms* is widely regarded as one of the most comprehensive textbooks on algorithms. It covers a broad range of algorithms in depth, with design and analysis techniques. It is used in universities all over the world for undergraduate and graduate courses in computer science.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized by idea from the CLRS book, with each notebook focusing on a particular algorithm or concept:

Each notebook includes:
- Use case of the algorithm
- Mathematical Analysis.
- Time complexity.
- Python implementations of the algorithm.
- Examples to demonstrate the algorithm's use.

## How to Use This Repository

To use this repository, you can clone it to your local machine or open the notebooks directly in GitHub or [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/). If you prefer to run the notebooks interactively, you can use [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install) locally or a cloud platform like [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

### Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DJ-Greenwood/AlgorithmsFromCLRS.git
cd AlgorithmsFromCLRS
```

### Running Notebooks

Ensure you have Jupyter installed:

```bash
pip install notebook
```

To launch Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Navigate to the notebook you wish to run and open it. You can then run the notebook cells interactively.
